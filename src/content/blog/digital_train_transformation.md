The business world is in a constant state of evolution, and with the advent of new technologies, digital transformation has become an essential requirement for companies wishing to remain competitive and relevant in the global landscape. It is in this context that the SMACT Competence Center's intensive program, "Digital Transformation Training," was conceived.

The winter edition of 2024 promises to be an extraordinary experience for managers, entrepreneurs, and professionals eager to thoroughly understand new technologies and their impact on the business world. With six training modules, the program offers a comprehensive overview of emerging technologies and best business practices to address digital transformation.

During these two intense days, participants will have the opportunity to explore various topics, guided by the expertise and experiences of academics, industry experts, technology providers, and entrepreneurs. Discussions will cover the Industrial Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, Collaborative Robotics, Digital Twins, Blockchain, and Computer Vision.

But the added value of this event lies not only in the presentation of theoretical concepts. After each training day, there will be a moment of discussion between speakers and participants, where it will be possible to discuss and share practical experiences from their own companies. This exchange of knowledge and ideas will further enrich the learning experience, providing concrete insights to tackle the challenges of digital transformation.

And what better place than Cortina d'Ampezzo to host such a stimulating event? In addition to the opportunity to deepen their knowledge, participants will have the chance to enjoy the splendid surroundings offered by this renowned location. Networking opportunities will abound, allowing professionals to meet, exchange ideas, and create collaborations that could shape the future of their industries.

In conclusion, "Digital Transformation Training" represents an unmissable opportunity for anyone interested in guiding their company to success in tomorrow's digital world. It is time to embrace change and prepare to tackle the challenges and opportunities that digital transformation has to offer. The future is now, and digital transformation is the path that will lead companies toward it.
