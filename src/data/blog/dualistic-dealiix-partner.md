## The dealii-X CoE aims to elevate existing pre-exascale applications of digital twins for the brain, heart, lungs, liver, and mechanobiology to exascale readiness, providing an ideal computational platform for the integration of the developed software

â€œdealii-X: an Exascale Framework for Digital Twins of the Human Body" is a pioneering project aimed at developing a scalable, high performance computational platform using the dealii library to create accurate digital twins of human organs.

This framework will leverage exascale computing capabilities and existing lighthouse applications to simulate complex biological processes in real-time, aiding in personalized medicine and advanced healthcare research. By integrating cutting-edge HPC technologies with multiphysics and multidisciplinary approaches, dealii-X will deliver unprecedented computational efficiency and fidelity in biological modelling.

The project represents a significant leap toward the future of medical diagnostics and treatment planning, offering a robust tool for researchers and clinicians alike.
